Shutter on Wayland Motivation
-----------------------------
Hi guys, my name is Maurizio, I'm from Italy
I'm an IT developer and I like the linux ecosystem
my bare metal installation has been Ubuntu for more than 10 years
... and I always loved "Shutter" !!!
this thing that Shutter does not work on Wayland started to bother me "a lot"
and so I decided to invest some time to resolve this question
the base idea was to leverage gnome-screenshot command line utility 
while maintaining the very same user interface and behaviour
want to see the new "Shutter" in action ?
check this:

or if you have Ubuntu 23.10 give it a try

Maurizio
